# Mini Project
Marianne Lee

## flask_web_service.py
* Deploy this web service with Marianne's vcm machine
* If asked nicely, she will do it for you. 

## client.py
* Simply running this will give all the printed statements with no user input.
## flexible_inputs.py
* There is now the option to give a string input for "name" in `greet` function if you want to see the computer say hello to you so badly (and not to Marianne).

* You can also use `distance` to give two points. Make sure they are lists of two floats/integers. 

* Feel free to break the code. I did not put any try/excepts.
